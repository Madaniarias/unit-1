① Start watching the videos posted on the resource stream for Unit 1.  (Link #8 in the Learning Log)

② Research. What are variables in computer programming? What types of variables can we use in Python?

R/. We refer to variable in computer programming as a way of referring to a storage area in a computer program.
This memory location holds values—numbers, text or more complicated types of data like payroll records [(Bolton, 2019)](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-variable-958320).
They are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. 
They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. 
It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. 
This data can then be used throughout your program [(LaunchSchool, 2022)](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/variables)

There are differnte variable types we can use in Python. Some of the most basic ones are:
-Integers and floats: Integers are numbers, and floats are decimal numbers. 
-Boolean and none: Indicates a True or a False value. You can assign any variable to be true or false and declaring a variable as a Boolean.
-Strings: To symbolize text. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or three times the quotes, either single or double.
-Lists: To define a List in Python, write a variable name and assign it empty square brackets.
-Dictionaries
-Other data types: Complex, Tuples, Bytes and Bytearray, Set and Frozenset
